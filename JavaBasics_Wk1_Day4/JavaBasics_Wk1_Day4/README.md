## Getting Started

1.	Implement Singleton with double checked locking.

2.	Write a program to create a deadlock between two threads.

3.	Write a program with one thread (the producer) that produces items (in this case simple int's). Another thread (the consumer) consumes items. For communication purposes both threads have access to a bounded buffer which is basically an array.

## JUnit

1.	Create a file called LineTest.java.

2.	Create tests for the getSlope, getDistance and parallelTo methods.

3.	Because of rounding errors, it is bad practice to test double values for exact equality. To get around this, you can pass a small value (such as .0001) to assertEquals to be used as a delta.
