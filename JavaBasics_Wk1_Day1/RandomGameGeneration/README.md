## Random Number Game

User is asked a question to guess a number (may be between 1-100)
if the number he guesses is within 10 numbers plus or minus of the number the java program has, then exit out and give the answer
if the number he guesses is not within 10 numbers, ask the user to keep trying and give him more chances.
if he is not able to guess within 5 chances, exit and display 'Sorry’ with the number.
Example: Random # generated is 63
User’s guess must be between 53 to 73.
