Focus Week is an opportunity for personnel to complete mandatory and discretionary leadership and acquisition training and earn continuous learning points. Dozens of courses will be available, ranging from career and functional area-specific training and coaching to personal development classes.

“We encourage all AFLCMC employees to keep their skills up to date and continue to take advantage of the many self-development opportunities we have available,” said Jason Sibrel, AFLCMC Focus Week program manager. “We are offering a wide range of course topics, from technical acquisition courses to those in soft-skill areas, like leadership and professional growth.”

A few courses on the schedule for acquisition professionals include Business Case Overview for Services Acquisition, Digital Transformation 101, and Cost Estimating for Acquisition Professionals. Platforms include teleconferences, Defense Collaboration Services, and Commercial Virtual Remote using Microsoft Teams.

“During registration, it is important to be mindful of course requirements, as some of the courses are new to the virtual-learning environment and may be offered in a variety of platforms,” Sibrel said.
